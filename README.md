# MultiAgentSystems-CV

Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent to tackle, and the coordination and collaboration between autonomous agents is the key to bring such systems to their full potential. In this project, a set of autonomous vehicles are coordinated to collaborate on a variety of problems, in a simulated UNITY environment with obstacles to avoid. 


Group projects:
- Path Planning (Marco Schouten)
- Vehicle Routing Problem (Marco Schouten, Xuecong Liu)
- Indoor UGV search (Marco Schouten, Xuecong Liu)
- Collision Avoidance (Marco Schouten, Justin Salér)
