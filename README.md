# MultiAgentSystems-CV

Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent to tackle, and the coordination and collaboration between autonomous agents is the key to bring such systems to their full potential. In this project, a set of autonomous vehicles are coordinated to collaborate on a variety of problems, in a simulated UNITY environment with obstacles to avoid. 


Group projects:
- Path Planning (Marco Schouten)
- Vehicle Routing Problem (Marco Schouten, Xuecong Liu)
- Indoor UGV search (Marco Schouten, Xuecong Liu)
- Collision Avoidance (Marco Schouten, Justin Salér)
- Drone Soccer (Marco Schouten, Justin Salér)

- a1
  - vehicle routing problem 
- a2
  - We use Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to perform Vacuum Cleaner Planning within a short time
  - and then apply DFS and BFS to solve Vehicle Routing Problem
  - which we combined with Minimum Set Cover algorithm to solve Indoor UGV search.
  - We implemented V-shape formation for formation sweep, 
  - Dijkstra algorithm for planning shooter coordination of three vehicles.
- a3
  - vehicle avoidance
  - drone soccer
- a4 starcraft bot
  - the ability of behaviour trees and back chaining for controlling a starcraft AI system.
